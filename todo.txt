-Add installation UI.

-Support hook packages. A hook package is a directory containing <hook>.d
 directories. We run each executable file inside <hook>.d for <hook>. A hook
 package may contain a .githooks.d.conf file to specify hook packages to run.

-Run user githooks first (those are just a hook package in ~/githooks.d).

-Support activating/deactivating hooks? Easy - only run executable files.
