- Take a close look at http://git-hooks.github.io/git-hooks/, which is similar
  to this project. It didn't exist when I started this, and looks different
  enough that I'll probably continue mine, but it would be worth understanding
  it before doing so.

- Take a close look at http://pre-commit.com/. It might be significantly closer
  to what I want than the other one in this file, but I'm not sure.

- Make hook packages environments isolated from each other.
  Running each hook package in its own subshell is the obvious way.

- Consider renaming things for consistency (run-hooks.sh could be
  'githooks.d.sh', and 'githooks.conf.sh' could be 'githooks.d.conf.sh'? Not
  great names...)

- Install operation should handle pre-existing hooks sanely.

- Use heredoc for all embedded shell scripts.
